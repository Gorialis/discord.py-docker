## Notice

The `rewrite` branch was merged into `master` on 2019-04-09, marking the end of the rewrite alpha stage. The `rewrite` tags will remain faithful to the old, now frozen, feature branch, so it is recommended to switch your containers to `master` to continue receiving development updates, or to switch to the new `pypi` tag.

## Image variants

This image comes in few variants depending on your use case:

### `discord.py:minimal`

This is the base, and therefore smallest, image. It contains only `discord.py` with voice and docs support, including ffmpeg and youtube-dl.

### `discord.py:full`

This is the default image. This contains some precompiled common dependencies, and as such, is much larger than the base image.

These dependencies are:
-   {{ minor_deps.keys()|inline_codeblock }}

This can help reduce bot installation time as packages that would otherwise take a long time to compile or acquire are already installed.

### `discord.py:extras`

This image extends the `full` image with more dependencies:
-   {{ major_deps.keys()|inline_codeblock }}

This image is therefore the largest image and is only recommended if you use a large variety of these dependencies.

## Using this image

### Create a Dockerfile for your project

```dockerfile
FROM gorialis/discord.py

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "bot.py"]
```

You can use tags if you need specific versions:

```dockerfile
FROM gorialis/discord.py:3.6-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "bot.py"]
```

Then you can build your image and run it:
```console
$ docker build -t my-bot .
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-bot my-bot
```

### Direct via console

If you are running one-time scripts, creating your own `Dockerfile` might be tedious. You can use this image directly from CLI like so:
```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-bot -v $PWD:/app -w /app gorialis/discord.py:rewrite python your-bot.py
```

You can also do this for tests:
```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-tests -v $PWD:/app -w /app gorialis/discord.py:rewrite pytest -vs
```

## Building this image

You can use the Dockerfiles listed with the tags above to build these images yourself.
The Dockerfiles themselves are autogenerated (last generated {{ now }}), and their templates are accessible via the [discord.py-docker repository](https://github.com/Gorialis/discord.py-docker).

The general format is as such:
```console
docker build --no-cache --tag <tag name> .
```

Note that these images can take quite a long time to build due to the amount of content included. It is for this reason that they are provided here, on Docker Hub, to use directly.
