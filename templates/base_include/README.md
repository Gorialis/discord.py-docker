## Tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

{% for tags in builds %}

## Extra dependencies

Many common dependencies are preinstalled in this image. These help shorten install times for derivative Dockerfiles, as well as allowing new dependencies to be built should it be necessary.

These dependencies are:

## Using this image

### Create a Dockerfile for your project

```dockerfile
FROM Gorialis/discord.py:rewrite

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "bot.py"]
```

You can use other tags if you need specific versions:

```dockerfile
FROM Gorialis/discord.py:3.6-alpine-0.16.12

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "bot.py"]
```

Then you can build your image and run it:
```console
$ docker build -t my-bot .
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-bot my-bot
```

### Direct via console

If you are running one-time scripts, creating your own `Dockerfile` might be tedious. You can use this image directly from CLI like so:
```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-bot -v $PWD:/app -w /app Gorialis/discord.py:rewrite python your-bot.py
```

You can also do this for tests:
```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-tests -v $PWD:/app -w /app Gorialis/discord.py:rewrite pytest -vs
```

## Building this image

You can use the Dockerfiles listed with the tags above to build these images yourself.
The Dockerfiles themselves are autogenerated (last generated {{ now }}), and their templates are accessible via the [discord.py-docker repository](https://github.com/Gorialis/discord.py-docker).

The general format is as such:
```console
docker build --no-cache --tag <tag name> .
```

Note that these images can take quite a long time to build due to the amount of content included. It is for this reason that they are provided here, on Docker Hub, to use directly.
