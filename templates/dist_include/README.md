## Building & uploading this image

Convenience files `build.sh` and `upload.sh` are included in this folder.
`deploy.sh` is also included, which simply performs both.

By default, `upload.sh` will attempt to upload to the [gorialis/discord.py repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/gorialis/discord.py).
To change this, set the environment variable `DOCKER_UPLOAD_REPOSITORY` to your user or org name.
For example, doing `export DOCKER_UPLOAD_REPOSITORY="example"` would upload to `example/discord.py:{{ primary }}`, etc.
