# this file works as a combination of Dockerfile arguments and Docker tags
# x: ["y", "z"] means the variable is x, and it is reflected in Docker tags y and z.
# tags should decrease in specificity along the list
# a blank tag means it is implicit when omitted
# this is used to automatically generate the Dockerfiles, metadata and readme.

python_versions:
  3.6.4: ["3.6.4", "3.6", "3", ""]
  #3.5.5: ["3.5.5", "3.5"] # dropped because no stretch image and libc has some issues
  #3.4.8: ["3.4.8", "3.4"] # dropped because not compatible with a lot of async drivers

distros:
  stretch: ["stretch", ""]
  slim-stretch: ["slim-stretch", "slim"]

extra_deps:
  # extra_deps is a list of lists
  # every top-level list is run as a different pip command
  # every sub-level list is installed together in one pip command
  # this is so that packages that require others to build install correctly
